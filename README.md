- **‚úã Fingerspelling**: Automatic fallback to fingerspelling for words not in dictionary
- **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playback Mode**: Sequential playback of signs with visual highlighting
- **üì± Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **üåê Static Deployment**: No backend required, perfect for Netlify deployment

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Google Chrome (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge
- ‚úÖ Safari (iOS/macOS)
- ‚ùå Firefox (limited support)

## How to Use

4. **Use playback** - Click "Play Sequence" to see signs one by one

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm start
```

Opens the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates a `build` folder with optimized static files ready for deployment.

## Deployment to Netlify

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Drag and drop the `build` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
   - Or connect your GitHub repo for continuous deployment

3. **Configure build settings** (if using Git):
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`

## Sign Language Dictionary

The app includes a comprehensive dictionary with:

- **Greetings**: hello, hi, goodbye, please, thank you

}
```
